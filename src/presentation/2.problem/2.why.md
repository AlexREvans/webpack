## Why Webpack?

   * Allows for encapsulation of individual scripts
   * Modules included and bundled as part of a concatenated output bundle
   * The benefits of concatenation whilst maintaining the benefits of JavaScript modules
   * Can also include resources, stylesheets and any other assets
   * Controlling the size and number of assets that make up your built product
   * Webpack is a *build-time* tool and doesn't load modules/etc at runtime
