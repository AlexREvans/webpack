## Tapable stages

   * The Webpack **compiler**
   * A unit of **compilation** (dependency graph)
   * The **resolver** finds candidate files
   * **Module factories** take a resolved file and produce the specification of a module to be included
   * **Parser** parses a module and builds a syntax tree to examine the module for any inclusion or dependencies. Loaders transform non JS to JS (so they'll always have JS dependencies)
   * **Templates** - how the dependency graph of the compilation tie together to form output

Each of these elements are exposed and can be plugged into.
