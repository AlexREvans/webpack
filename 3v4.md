Road to Webpack 5
There are several plans underway for Webpack 5. Some of these plans include:

Stable WebAssembly support.
The ability to create a custom module type and have Webpack support it.
Eliminating ExtractTextWebpackPlugin and supporting a CSS module type out of the box.
Supporting HTML module type out of the box.
Persistent Caching
