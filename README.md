# Webpack

## Using the project

Requires docker & docker-compose (v3 yml). You can examine the toolchain being used in [Dockerfile]().

Load useful aliases into your session using `sourcer alias`.

To build an example:


   * Run `eg`
   * Enter example number at prompt

For the development example, you can run the `webpack-dev-server` using `startdev`.

For the production environment example, you can:

   * Perform a dev build, run `yarn build:dev`
   * Perform a prod build, run `yarn build:prod`
   * Between each build you can run `yarn deadcode` to test whether the build removed a dead JS function from the last-run bundled output
